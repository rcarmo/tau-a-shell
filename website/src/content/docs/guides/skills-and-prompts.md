title: Skills & prompt templates
description: Teach Tau reusable know-how with skills, and stop retyping instructions with prompt templates.
---

Tau loads two kinds of reusable Markdown from disk: **skills** (how to do a
task) and **prompt templates** (a saved prompt you trigger by name). Both can
live at the user level (available everywhere) or inside a project.

## Where the files go

Skills are loaded from these locations, in increasing precedence (later
overrides earlier on name clashes):

```text
~/.tau/skills/
~/.agents/skills/
~/.agents/
<cwd>/.tau/skills/
<cwd>/.agents/skills/
<cwd>/.agents/
```

Prompt templates load from:

```text
~/.tau/prompts/
~/.agents/prompts/
<cwd>/.tau/prompts/
<cwd>/.agents/prompts/
```

After adding or editing files while the TUI is open, run **`/reload`** to
rediscover them. Duplicate/overridden resources are reported as diagnostics, not
fatal errors.

## Skills

A skill is a Markdown file describing how to accomplish something. The filename
is the skill name. Optional frontmatter gives it a description:

```md
---
description: Review a diff for security issues.
---

Steps to review the current diff for security problems...
```

Tau lists loaded skills in the system prompt so the model knows they exist and
can read the full file (via the `read` tool) when relevant. Invoke one
explicitly:

```text
/skill:security-review check the changes on this branch
```

`/skill:<name>` is a *prompt-expansion* path — Tau expands the skill into your
prompt and runs it as a normal turn.

## Prompt templates

A prompt template is a saved prompt you trigger by its filename. For example
`~/.agents/prompts/wt.md` becomes the prompt `wt`. Templates can include
variables with `{{ name }}`:

```md
---
description: Implement a feature in an isolated git worktree.
---

Implement this feature safely in a new worktree:
{{ feature }}
```

If a template has no placeholders, your arguments are appended after a blank
line. Variables are filled from the arguments you pass when invoking it.

## Skill vs. prompt template — which?

- Use a **prompt template** when you keep typing the *same instructions* and
  just want a shortcut (with optional fill-in variables).
- Use a **skill** when you want to give the model *reference know-how* it can
  pull in when a task calls for it, invoked with `/skill:<name>`.

:::tip
Keep personal, cross-project helpers in `~/.agents/`. Keep project-specific ones
in the repo's `.tau/` or `.agents/` so they're shared with collaborators.

## Shared contributor prompts

Repositories can include prompt templates for common contribution workflows. Tau
itself includes project-level templates for drafting structured issues and pull
requests:

```text
/issue describe the bug or feature request
/pr add any reviewer context for the current branch
```

Good shared prompts should not assume every contributor has the same local setup.
If `gh`, GitHub authentication, remotes, or dependencies are unavailable, the
prompt should still produce copy/paste-ready Markdown and manual next steps.
